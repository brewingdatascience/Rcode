# outline


#Wickham:  four activities of analysis:
*tidy
*transform
*visualize
*model


# dplyr: filter, select, mutate, summarise, arrange (and group_by)
## five verbs of dplyr (Wickham)
* filter:  keep rows matching criteria
* select:  pick columns by name
* arrange: reorder rows (aka sort)
* mutate:  add new variables 
* summarise: reduce variables to values
* group_by: (the 6th verb?)

# intro text!
if you care about what this means in a brewing context, first read the manuscript (link above).  This is simply an attempt to develop a metric such that "hop freshening power" can be incorporated into models of the warm-dryhopping process.  


# Goals
* express the ABW increase associated with dryhopping in terms of amount of hops added


# Restart R and Load packages

#To do
*convert dates from 'character' to 'POSIX' date format
*calculate mean ABW increase relative to control (NH) for each experimental group.
**close inspection of the data shows that the beer in expt2 was not entirely end-fermented when dry-hopped.  This is evidenced by the fact that the control (NH) samples in those experiments increased by an average of ~0.15% ABV over the 42-day time-course of those experiments.  To account for this we will need to  create factor that allows us to group_by these discrete experimental groups (including separate groups for each 'expt2' time-point) so we can compute the mean baseline (NH) for each group.  
## reword the above!




## create new variables (*.POSIXct, timeofaddition, daysonhops, hops_g_100mL, pounds_bbl, variety, harvestyear,ox)
```{r}
### note: this is a base R data wrangling exercise! in general it's best to use lubridate package for date/timestamps! 

## can do one at a time (here we're creating new columns in POSIXct format, based on the particular date format used in the source data (ujbc_a_1469081_sm5496.txt; see ?as.POSIXct):
#x_brew_date.POSIXct<- as.POSIXct(mydata$brew_date, format = "%m/%d/%Y") # as a standalone vector (USELESS here), or:
#mydata$brew_date.POSIXct <-as.POSIXct(mydata$brew_date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")  # as a "new column" in our dataframe
  
## or, we can take advantage of the pattern that of our (character) date/time columns have the string "date" in the headername.  First make character vector of all column names containing string "date":
datecols<- dput(names(select(mydata, matches("date"))))  ## headers containing string "date"

## FORLOOP
# this forloop will (attempt to) convert datecols (define above) into POSIXct format (R datetime format).  In general they say it's  ### best to avoid forloops ### use functions from lubridate/etc packages with specific tools for the task at hand)!! ###
for (icol in datecols) {
  newcol = paste0(icol,".POSIXct")
  print(newcol)
  mydata[, newcol] = as.POSIXct(mydata[, icol],format = "%m/%d/%Y") ###  CREATE NEW columns with POSIXct   
#  mydata[, newcol] = as.POSIXct(as.numeric(mydata[, icol])  * (60*60*24), origin="1899-12-30") ###  microsoft times
}

## create timeofaddition, daysonhops, hops_g_100mL, pounds_bbl variables with dplyr "mutate"
mydata<- mydata %>% 
  mutate(timeofaddition = as.numeric(difftime(dryhop_date.POSIXct,brew_date.POSIXct)),
         daysonhops = as.numeric(difftime(Test_Date.POSIXct,dryhop_date.POSIXct)),
         hops_g_100mL = (mg_hops/volume_mL)/10,
         pounds_bbl = (mg_hops/volume_mL)*117/454
         )

mydata$OX<-grepl("OX", mydata$Hop_type)           ##  create logical "OX" column
mydata$rouse<-grepl("rouse", mydata$special_group)##  create logical "rouse" column
mydata$Grind<-grepl("Grind", mydata$Hop_type)     ##  create logical column
mydata$Cone<-grepl("Cone", mydata$Hop_type)       ##  create logical column
mydata$harvest2014<-grepl("14", mydata$Hop_type)  ##  create logical column
mydata$harvest2015<-grepl("15", mydata$Hop_type)  ##  create logical column
mydata$harvest2017<-grepl("17", mydata$Hop_type)  ##  create logical column
## ifelse statement for harvestyear (if neither 2014 nor 2015 nor 2017, then 2016)
mydata$harvestYear <- ifelse(
  mydata$harvest2014==TRUE, 2014,
  ifelse(mydata$harvest2015==TRUE, 2015, 
         ifelse(mydata$harvest2017==TRUE, 2017, 2016)))
## ifelse statement for form of hops (if neither cone nor ground nor NH, then pellet) 
mydata$form_of_hops <- ifelse(
  mydata$Cone==TRUE, "cone",
  ifelse(mydata$Grind==TRUE, "ground",
         ifelse(mydata$Hop_type=="NH", "NH", "pellet")))

## ifelse statement for temperature greater or less than 10 
mydata$temperature_during_dryhop <- ifelse(
  mydata$temp.C<10, "cold",
  ifelse(mydata$temp.C>10, "warm", "something else"))

## create "variety" column starting with "Hop_type" then stripping away all the non-variety information
mydata$variety<-mydata$Hop_type
mydata$variety<- gsub("17","", mydata$variety)
mydata$variety<- gsub("16","", mydata$variety)
mydata$variety<- gsub("15","", mydata$variety)
mydata$variety<- gsub("14","", mydata$variety)
mydata$variety<- gsub("OX","", mydata$variety)
mydata$variety<- gsub("Grind","", mydata$variety)
mydata$variety<- gsub("Cone","", mydata$variety)
mydata$variety<- gsub(" ","", mydata$variety)

## create "EXPTnew" variable to account for beer not being end-fermented when time-series (expt 2A) commenced
mydata<- mydata %>% mutate(EXPTnew=paste0("group",expt, substr(special_group, 1,2)))
# clean it up by removing "NA" and any spaces due to canarycode bug
mydata$EXPTnew <- gsub(" ","", mydata$EXPTnew)  ## remove any spaces
mydata$EXPTnew <- gsub("NA","", mydata$EXPTnew) ## remove "NA"
```


Now we've created several new variables including everything we need to calculate ABW increase due to dry-hopping.  First some cleanup:
```{r}
## rearrange columns (experimental factors on the left, then measurements, followed by calculations and finally all the date columns on the right):
mydata <- mydata %>% 
  select(sample_id,EXPTnew, hop, BINhop, variety, OX, rouse, harvestYear, form_of_hops, daysonhops, timeofaddition, temperature_during_dryhop, temp.C, hops_g_100mL, pounds_bbl,
         ABV, ABW, OE, Er, Ea, SG, RDF, ADF, Calories, 
         dhop_day, contact_days, REF_NH, ABV_increase, 
         brew_date.POSIXct, sample_collection_date.POSIXct, dryhop_date.POSIXct, Test_Date.POSIXct)
## remove ".POSIXct" suffix.  Leaving it as-is will only add to confusion if/when these data are saved and re-imported (and become 'character' format!)
colnames(mydata) = gsub(".POSIXct", "", colnames(mydata))
```



```{r}

#compute baseline ABW for each EXPTnew group
meanABW.REF_NH<- mydata %>% 
  group_by(EXPTnew) %>%
  filter(hop=="NH") %>%
  summarise(ABW.REF_NH=mean(ABW))
meanABW.REF_NH
```


## compute FPH
compute mean increase in ABW relative to meanABW.REF_NH (unhopped samples in same EXPTnew group), and normalize this relative to the exact amount of hops added.  Also calculate CO2 production using Balling formula and similarly normalize calculated CO2 relative to the exact amount of hops added.
```{r}
## using objects created above...
## first join our data with mean ABV for unhopped samples in given experiment (meanABW.REF_NH; calculated above)
FPHcalc<- left_join(mydata, meanABW.REF_NH, by="EXPTnew")

## now calculate ABW_increase by subtracting each individual ABW measurement from meanABW.REF_NH:
FPHcalc$ABW_increase <- FPHcalc$ABW - FPHcalc$ABW.REF_NH

## the control samples have served their purpose, now remove them from dataset. These following calculations are only meaningful for dry-hopped samples.  
FPHcalc<- FPHcalc %>% filter(hop=="DH")

## compute corresponding CO2 production following Bamforth (describing Balling equation) "...more realistically, the ethanol yield is more like 0.46 g and carbon dioxide 0.44 g from 1 g sugar"  (p. 137 in Brewing Materials and Processes: A Practical Approach to Beer Excellence, Edited by Charles Bamforth Academic Press, 2016)
FPHcalc$calcCO2_increase <- FPHcalc$ABW_increase*(0.44/0.46)
##convert calcCO2_increase (in g/100mL) to calculated CO2 volumes added
## g/L = 10* g/100mL
## The conversion factor from volumes of CO2 to CO2 by weight (g/L) is 1.96. For example: 2.5 volumes x 1.96 = 4.9 g/l.
FPHcalc$calcCO2vols_increase <- FPHcalc$calcCO2_increase*10/1.96

## and define "FPH" as the amount produced per % dry-hops added (in g/100mL):
FPHcalc$FPH_EtOH = FPHcalc$ABW_increase/FPHcalc$hops_g_100mL
FPHcalc$FPH_CO2 = FPHcalc$calcCO2_increase/FPHcalc$hops_g_100mL

## and save the transformed data to csv:
write.csv(FPHcalc,"FPHcalc.csv", row.names = FALSE)

##vanity table
df<- FPHcalc %>% group_by(variety,form_of_hops,daysonhops,harvestYear,OX, temperature_during_dryhop) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(hops_g_100mL,pounds_bbl, ABW_increase,FPH_EtOH, FPH_CO2, calcCO2vols_increase),funs(mean)) %>%
  arrange(desc(FPH_EtOH)) 
df$OX<- as.character(df$OX)
df$daysonhops<- as.integer(df$daysonhops)
df$harvestYear<- as.integer(df$harvestYear)
df$ABW_increase<- substr(as.character(df$ABW_increase,2), 1,4)
df$hops_g_100mL<- substr(as.character(df$hops_g_100mL,2), 1,4)
df$pounds_bbl<- substr(as.character(df$pounds_bbl,2), 1,4)
df$FPH_EtOH<- substr(as.character(df$FPH_EtOH,2), 1,4)
df$FPH_CO2<- substr(as.character(df$FPH_CO2,2), 1,4)
df$calcCO2vols_increase<- substr(as.character(df$calcCO2vols_increase,2), 1,4)
df <- as.data.frame(df) 
df %>%  regulartable() %>% autofit()
```
We now have a single variable (FPH) that accounts for both the amount of hops added and the amount of ethanol produced.  We will use this variable to create models that [attempt to] relate variables such as hop variety, form of hops, time on hops, age and storage conditions of hops, and temperature during dryhopping, to the amount of ethanol produced due to dry-hopping.
# tranform complete.  We will use this output as basis for modeling work.
